# Competitions-and-Datasets

This repository contains my own models for several kaggle competitions and famous datasets. I've implemented Machine Learning algorithms ranging from support vector machines, gradient boosting machines to convolutional neural networks to ensemble methods such as majority voting, random forest, and stacking, which has allowed me to consistently rank in the top half of leaderboards.

1)Spaceship Titanic- 79.4% accuracy  
2)Titanic Dataset: 81% accuracy  
3)Iceberg Classification: 0.46 negative log likelihood  
4)MNIST: 98.4% with SVM, 99.5% with CNN  
5)CIFAR-10: 85% with CNN
